# Prolog Tasks 

1. **Boycott Guide**
 - The `Src.pl` file involves writing predicates to manage customer orders, identify boycott items and their alternatives, and perform various operations on orders.
 - The `Data.pl` File it contain all our data boycott items ,alternatives,customers data  

2. **Cycle Detection**
 - The `DFS_Color_Cycle.pl` file contain Prolog code to solve a puzzle involving finding color cycles on a board. The puzzle involves a board consisting of cells with three different colors (Red, Yellow, or Blue), and the objective is to find cycles of the same color where each cell is adjacent to the next one

3. **Path Finding**
 - The `Astar Algorithm.pl` file involves prolog code to solve a puzzle involving finding a path between start and goal cells of the same color on a board. The puzzle is solved using informed search with the A* algorithm.
